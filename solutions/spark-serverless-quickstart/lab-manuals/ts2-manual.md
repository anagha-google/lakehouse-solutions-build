#### 1.8.3. Lab Solution Architecture

In the lab, we will simulate a data analyst that reads data, transforms it a bit for analysis and visualizes it. We will read Chicago crimes public dataset in BigQuery with the Spark BigQuery connector from Google Cloud, from the different notebook flavors. We will analyze crimes and visualize them in the notebooks. Note that the lab is less about Apache Spark and more about the serverless Spark sessions support in notebooks, so the labs are basic.

# 2. Product Highlights

Read the blog post [Lakehouse Demystified - Part 2: Managed service for Apache Spark - serverless batches]() for a comprehensive of managed serverless Spark on Google Cloud. Please refer to the [Lakehouse Demystified - Part 3: Managed service for Apache Spark - serverless interactive sessions for Spark notebooks]() blog post for comprehensive coverage on interactive sessions.

## 2.1.  Interactive sessions
Interactive sessions on serverless Managed Service for Apache Spark are essentially dedicated serverless Spark infrastructure that can be attached to notebooks for interactive authoring of Spark code. There are two options to connect notebooks to interactive sessions - Spark Connect and Jupyter. BigQuery studio offers Colab notebooks that work with Spark Connect, any Jupyter compatible notebook platform works well with remote Jupyter kernels. Google Cloud's Data Cloud Extension for IDEs allow you to author notebooks in your IDEs with remote Jupyter kernels. 

## 2.2. Language support
Google Cloud is strategically investing in supporting PySpark. 

## 2.3. Interactive session templates
Interactive session templates are a construct that can be used to define the core and common serverless infrastructure specifications & guardrails - such as runtime versions, baseline resources for driver & executor, min-max thresholds for executors, custom containers, packages, metastore/catalog configurations and more. These promote consistency and reduce toil of defining the configs over and over again in each notebook. These templates can be imported into the Spark session creation command to take advantage of the predefined configurations. This is demonstrated in the lab. [Read the product documenation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs/guides/create-serverless-sessions-templates)

## 2.4. Identity supported
Interactive sessions support both User Managed Service Accounts (UMSAs - non human application IDs) as well as end user credentials (EUC). You can configure this at the session template level.

# 3. Lab Setup

<hr>

## 3.1. Setup -  initialize active gcloud configuration

Run the following commands in Cloud Shell to authenticate and configure your active project. Ensure its the same project as technical solution 1.

1. Initialization:
```
gcloud init
```

2. Set the active Google Cloud project target:
```
gcloud config set project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
```

3. Set the quota project for ADC (Application Default Credentials):
```
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
```

<hr>


## 3.2. Setup - create an interactive sessions template for Spark Connect, for PySpark and using a Service Account 

To recap - session template is to bootstrap of common configurations to standardize, reduce toil, and spped development/analysis cycles. 
1. There is no gcloud command to create session templates, so we will use the Console.
2. We will use a service account for the session template instead of individual user for simplicity. Our service account already has all permissions. This means that Spark will run and access data as the configured service account.

### 3.2.1. Capture the service account fully qualified name (FQN)

Navigate to Cloud IAM and find the service account as show below and copy it.

## 3.5. Setup - Install local Jupyter on your machine

This is the documentation page. https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs/quickstarts/jupyterlab-sessions#install-jupyterlab-extension
The author used a slightly different approach as detailed below.

### 3.5.1. Authenticate to gcloud

1. Run the command below - it will use the credentials obtained from the login flow to also update the Application Default Credentials, making them available to client libraries
```
gcloud auth login --update-adc
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install jupyterlab and more
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab
pip install bigquery-jupyter-plugin
pip install pyOpenSSL
```

4. Launch JupyterLab
```
jupyter lab
```

![README](../images/ts2-11a.png)

### 4.1.4. Create a spark session off of the session template we created

We created a session template for Spark Connect on [section 3.2.3](./ts2-manual.md#323-create-the-session-template). Here is how we create a spark session in the notebook that connects with a managed serverless interactive session (infrastructure) off of a predefined template.<br>
To customize the session further, refer [docs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/use-spark).<br>

1. Run the first cell to see understand what happens.

![README](../images/ts2-12i.png)   
<br><br>

2. It takes 2 minutes or less to create the interactive session. 
   
![README](../images/ts2-12i.png)   
<br><br>

3. Run the second cell

![README](../images/ts2-12n.png)

There is an unavoidable startup latency with interactive sessions. When there are cases where resource contention is not a concern, you can create an interactive session manually and connect multiple notebooks to it.

Here is the gcloud command.

```
gcloud beta dataproc sessions create spark $SESSION_NAME  \
--project=${PROJECT_ID} \
--location=${REGION} \
--subnet=$SUBNET \
--version $RUNTIME_VERSION
```
